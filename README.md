- **Python 3.11 or higher**: [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- **PostgreSQL**: [Download PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
- **pgAdmin** (optional, for database management): [Download pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/download/)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cis_benchmark_python.git
   cd cis_benchmark_python
   ```

2. **Configure PostgreSQL Database**:
   - Make sure PostgreSQL is running.
   - Create a database in PostgreSQL for storing CIS benchmark results.
   - Update your database connection details in the Python script or configuration file.

## Running the Program
